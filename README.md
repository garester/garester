- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @garester My name is Gary. I'm entirely new here and feeling completely lost in this environment. 
- I'm not very tech savvy when it comes to this level of computer stuff. The vocabulary especially confuses me. 
- Please forgive me any lack of knowledge or faux pas I may make. Thanks in advance. 
- ðŸ‘€ I often find myself with projects that are just almost beyond my capabilities. I'm very independent and prefer 
- to learn on my own without wasting someone else's time for them to teach me. Having said that, I LOVE to confer with 
- others about new stuff in order to learn (if they have time and are interested in doing so) or to share knowledge if I possess it. 
- My interests are broad and can range from boats to engines to mechanics to computers in an instant, depending on my mood. 
- It just depends on my current journey. 
- The reason I'm here is because Iâ€™m interested in creating a media server on my boat to supply audio and video files to 
- different devices such as a PS3, laptops, Adroid devices, Chromecast, etc. Ultimately, I would also like to create a 
- larger home server that would do the same only more extensively. I'm trying to figure out what the easiest and most cost 
- effective way to do that would be.  Simplicity is key because once I encounter enough road blocks my interest will fade 
- and I'll drop the project. Unfortunately. So I try to keep my projects in a type of limbo between do-able and impossible. 
- This usually satisfies both my need to challenge myself and my need to succeed.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning new things and I like a challenge.  I jump from one thing to the next continuously. Sometimes because 
- although I want to do the project, I may not currently own the knowledge, skills or materials to do that job. I will then 
- "work in the background" until I've either gathered the necessary things or have decided it's no longer necessary. Often times 
- it's more about doing the project than having the finished product to enjoy, although it is nice when something comes to fruition.
- ðŸ’ž Iâ€™m not really looking to collaborate on anything in particular, but like to leave things open in case in the future something comes up.  
- I'm always willing to lend help or advice if I'm able and can do so.
- ðŸ“« The best way to reach me is by email.  garester@comcast.net
- THANKS FOR READING
